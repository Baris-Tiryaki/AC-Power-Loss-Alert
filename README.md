# AC-Power-Loss-Alert

I wrote this program to specifically warn me when AC power is lost, since my battery lasts a few minutes.

Use/modify at your own risk.

<br>

Window stays hidden during normal use. It re-appears when AC power is lost.

AC Power loss is alerted with auditory beeps.

It also increases the master volume to "minVolume" level temporarily before playing sounds.

<br>

Does not automatically start at system startup yet.

Works on Windows 10.

Compiled with gcc version 11.2.0 (Rev10, Built by MSYS2 project)
